cktrace.sh ../../linux_mainline/vmlinux auto < /opt/linux_work/kernel_modules/decode-stacktrace/stacktrace.txt
to decode stacktrace from https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=00d13e505ef530a45100.
However, there was no need to decode as it seems it was already decoded in the bug report. I went to
another bug report and they had the decoded output for the stack trace as well. This is nice because
from the sample crash report for a bug, I can visit different files that were evoked as well as the 
specific line numbers for them. Clicking on it takes me to the git.kernel.org page and laods the page
to the line number that was referenced. Not sure what to do with this information as there are a lot of 
files that were called and the stack trace is decently long.

Quite confusing when first looking at the page because there is a lot of information present
on the page. I will have to look at what the bottom part is as it seems to be doing backups of kernels
with specified time below. It doesn't look like it has anything to do with the actual bug and seems to 
be separate but complemtary to what's on the top part of the page for the bug report.
